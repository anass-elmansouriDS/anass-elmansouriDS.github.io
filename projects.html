									<h3>Heart Disease Classification</h3>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hd.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this heart disease classification project utilizing machine learning, the objective was to create a model that accurately predicts the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals based on their medical data and relevant risk factors. The project began by collecting a dataset that incorporated various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, family history, and lifestyle habits.</p>

									<h3>Bulldozers Price Prediction</h3>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bd.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this project, the goal was to develop a model that accurately forecasts the prices of bulldozers over time. The project began by gathering a dataset comprising historical bulldozer prices, including associated dates or timestamps. To preprocess the data, various techniques were applied, such as handling missing values, ensuring chronological order, and potentially transforming variables to meet the assumptions of time series modeling. The dataset was then divided into training and testing sets, taking care to maintain the temporal order of the data.</p>

									<h3>Dog Breed Identification</h3>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/dog.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this project, the objective was to develop a model capable of accurately identifying the breed of dogs based on input images. The project commenced by collecting a diverse dataset of dog images encompassing various breeds. To prepare the data for training, preprocessing techniques were employed, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the dataset's diversity and improve the model's ability to generalize. The dataset was then split into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.</p>

									<h3>Machine failure classification</h3>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mf.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this project focused on machine failure classification, the goal was to develop a model that could accurately classify whether a given machine is prone to face a failure or not. The project began by collecting a dataset of machines that had been labeled as either prone to failure or not.</p>
